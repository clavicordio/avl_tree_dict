# avl_tree_dict
Associative array based on AVL-tree.

# Task
Develop a class that stores parameters necessary for work. 
A parameter can be either a *number*, an *array of numbers*, or a *text string*.
Every parameter is associated with a search key (string without spaces).
Parameters and their keys are stored in a text file.
The class should load parameters from a file and provide them by key through class methods.
The implementation should be based on a self-balancing binary search tree.
